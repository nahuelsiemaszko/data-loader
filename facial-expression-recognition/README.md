# Facial Expression Recognition

## Overview

This project, developed in Python, first involves training and testing a model using a provided dataset to then use that trained model to capture and recognize facial expressions in real-time through the device's camera.
The project leverages popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or Keras for model construction and training, and utilizes OpenCV for image capturing and recognition.
