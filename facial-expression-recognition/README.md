# Facial Expression Recognition

## Overview

This project was developed in Python and uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to first train and test a model given a provided dataset, and then use it to capture and recognize facial expressions in real-time through the device's camera.

The project utilizes TensorFlow for model construction and training, and OpenCV for image capturing and recognition.
