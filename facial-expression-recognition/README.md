# Facial Expression Recognition

## Overview

This project, developed in Python, first involves training and testing a model using a provided dataset to then use that trained model to capture and recognize facial expressions in real-time through the device's camera.

The project utilizes TensorFlow for model construction and training, and OpenCV for image capturing and recognition.
