# Facial Expression Recognition

## Overview

This Python project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to first train and test a model with a provided dataset, and then use it to capture and recognize facial expressions in real-time through the device's camera.

The project uses TensorFlow for model construction and training, and OpenCV for image capturing and recognition.
